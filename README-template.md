## My process
I started this build by 'blocking out' the elements using divs with different coloured borders. This allowed me to get used to Tailwind and experiment with the basics. 

After that, I built one of the 'cards' then copied the design the other 6 and amended the larger one to fit the design. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CDN (https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

This project taught me how to use Tailwind. 

With Tailwind, the document customization is done in the HTML doc, rather than a separate CSS file. Here's an example of how the HTML doc looks with Tailwind compared to standard CSS.

----Without Tailwind-----
```html
<h1 class="stardard css">This is standard CSS</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: #x1x1x1;
  width: x;
  height: x;
}
```
----With Tailwind-----
```html
<h1 class="h-x w-x text-slate-50">This is standard CSS</h1>
```

In this example the Tailwind looks cleaner. There is less code and everything is one on page. But when you add more classes and more elements, the document becomes crowded and it becomes hard to see the barebones HTML. 

<div class="border-4 border-slate-900 ">
            <div class="border-4 border-slate-900 flex mb-1">
                <div class="relative h-44 w-48 bg-orange-400 m-4 rounded-lg">

Aside from Tailwind, This project has taught me about styling, formating and planning. Wheras in the past I might have jumped into this project blind, this time I took time to plan the project and where each element would go. Ultimately this saved me time and made my coding more organised. 

### Continued development

- Continue the build by adding the Javascript functions


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tailwind-css/) - This helped with using Flex in Tailwind. I found the demonstrations clearer than the ones on the Tailwind website.
